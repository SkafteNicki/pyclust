# pyclust

Small collection of functions that I use in my daily work life to make some tasks easier.

* check_cluster.py -> check which clusters/gpu's are free to use at the moment
* my_usage.py -> check which gpu's I am currently using
* run_command.py -> ssh to a cluster, pull a library and runs a given command. Output is redirected to the terminal.
* grapher.sh -> bash script that plots the current gpu memory consumption
